# Weekly Projects

Each week, you'll have a project to complete, either as an individual, or with teammates. The projects will bring together the skills you learn that week.

This page will list all of the projects, so you have a convenient place to find them.

* [Week 1: CS Professor Home Page](lessons/foundations/project.md)
* [Week 2: Article Page](lessons/web-design/project.md)
* [Week 3: Content Gallery](lessons/action-and-interaction/project.md)
* [Final Project](./final-project.md)

Note that there are no Weekly Projects in weeks 4 or 5, so that you have time to
work on your Final Project.

## Submission and Grading

You will complete each of the projects in Github, then submit your work in
Gradescope and Woolf.

On each project page, you'll find a rubric that will be used to evaluate your work.

Each of the 3 weekly projects count for 15 points of your final grade. 

The final project counts for 30 points of your final grade.
