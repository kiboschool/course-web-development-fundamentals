## What you'll learn

This course provides a foundation in building for the web. It will help you understand how the internet works, help you examine the role of the internet in your life, and teach you the basics of web development.

It will cover the building blocks of web technologies. You will learn HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript. The course will focus on collaboration, communication, and sharing. Web technology is fundamentally social; you will work together and build for real audiences.

The course culminates in a project where you'll create a website of your own design using the tools you learn throughout the course.

## Course Overview

* Week 1: Foundations
* Week 2: Web Design
* Week 3: JavaScript
* Week 4: Layout and Multimedia
* Week 5: Review and Final Project

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

* Read and engage with the materials on this site
* Attend live class and complete the activities in class
* Practice with exercises to try out the concepts
* Complete projects to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try 
building lots of websites, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice outside of the 
practice problems included in the course.

## Assessments

Your overall course grade is made up of:

* **Class Participation (30%)** will based on submission of the activities
    or exercises in the live class, and scored based on completion, not
    correctness. If you miss a class, you will be expected to review the
    recording of the class and submit the activity or exercise from class.
* **Weekly Assignments (40%)**: Each week, you will have several ungraded exercises to 
    practice the concepts you learned. You will also have a graded 
    project each week. There are 3 such projects, each worth 15 points of your 
    final grade.
* **Final Project (30%)**: You will have one larger project at the end of the course, 
    reflecting all that you've learned. It contributes 30% of your final grade.

Your projects will be hosted on Github and turned in on Gradescope (see the 
Tools section below). Projects will be scored in Gradescope based on whether 
they complete the task successfully and effectively.

More details about live classes and your assignments are given on the next pages.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up 
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in [https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides)

*Github* is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project 
and assignment code. *Github Classroom* is a tool for assigning individual and 
team projects on Github. *Github Pages* are a way to host websites directly from
your Github project.

*VSCode* is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve programming 
assignments.

*Google Chrome* is a web browser. You'll use it when building sites and when
debugging your code.

*Gradescope* is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment submissions 
and give you feedback on your work.

*Woolf* is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that you 
get credit towards your degree.
