## Objects

JavaScript's equivalent for Python's dictionaries are called _objects_. They also use the curly brace syntax to create them and the square brackets to access items inside.

```js
let party = {
  "name": "Birthday Party",
  "date": "November 20",
  "guests": ["Mom", "Dad", "Brother"]
}
console.log(party["date"]) // November 20
```

JavaScript uses objects even more heavily than Python uses Dictionaries, but we won't go any deeper in this class.
