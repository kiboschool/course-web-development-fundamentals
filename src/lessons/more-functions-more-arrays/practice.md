If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, ask for help on Discord or attend Office Hours. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## Mandatory Exercises
This week, the mandatory exercises are:

1. **Prime Checker**:In this exercise, you would write a program to determine if a given number is a prime number. You would also need to check if the given input is a number.

1. **Palindrome Checker**: In this exercise, you would write a program to determine if a given input is a palindrome. 

1. **Three-digit Armstrong**: In this exercise, you would write a program to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. You would also need to check if the given input is a three-digit number in the first place.

1. **Math Helper**:In this exercise you will write a program to help calculate different math functions. This exercise combines the other three exercises in this week, namely, the Prime  Checker, Palindrome Checker and the Three-digit Armstrong. Given a single interface, a user can specify which of the three math functions to be computed and the appropriate answer would be generated.
