# Debugging

This is the process of finding and resolving identified bugs within computer programs, software, or systems.

In JavaScript the three frequently used method in debugging an application including:
* Using console log within a browser enabled platform
* Using a breakpoint
* Using a debugger

## Console Log
The function `console.log(<value>)` can be used to display JavaScript values in the Console tab of our Devtools. This method however is quite helpful, but is not the most efficient approach. Notwithstanding, there are different ways to use the console for debugging.
