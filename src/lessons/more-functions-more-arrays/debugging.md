# Debugging

This is the process of finding and resolving identified bugs within computer programs, software, or systems.

In JavaScript the three frequently used method in debugging an application include
* Using console log within a browser enabled platform
* Using a breakpoint
* Using a debugger

## Console Log
The function `console.log(<value>)` can be used to display JavaScript values in the debugger window


## Breakpoint
A single or multiple breakpoints acn be set in a debugger window. At each breakpoint, code execution will be paused, making it possible to examine available JavaScript values.


## Debugger
The debugger keyword can be used to temporarily pause the execution of JavaScript. The is similar to setting breakpoint, however has no effect on browsers that doesn't have support for it.
