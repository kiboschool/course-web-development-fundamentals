# Assignment: Publish and share a site

<aside>


üí° This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-web** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## üñºÔ∏è **Publish and share a site**

Instead of focusing on building from scratch, this project asks you to polish a previous project, publish it, and share it.

- Find one of your prior projects (the Portfolio project from your live classes, the Content Gallery, or your CS Professor page might be a good choice, but you can pick any project).
- Make that project even better
    - Test it, and make improvements
    - Add `<title>` and `<meta>` tags to give it cool link previews
    - Add a favicon
    - Write a Readme file
- Publish your site
    - You can use Replit, Github Pages, or something else
    - If you want, set up a custom domain for your site
- Share your site
    - Send the link in Discord to share with the Kibo Community
    - Share the link with friends, family, or classmates, to show off what you‚Äôve learned

There isn‚Äôt a separate Replit for you to start or submit this project. We‚Äôll see your work when you share it in Discord.

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
