# Publishing your site

You want to share your website with someone else. That means that somewhere, there has to be a server to send the files to the browser.

# Using Replit

Every Replit web project has a built-in published version. You don’t need to do anything special to publish your Replit site, it’s automatically published.

When you run your code, the preview window has a **public URL** and an “open in new tab” button that links to your site. So cool!

This is great! You can share the link with anyone you want, and they can see your site.

There are a couple downsides:

- Replit sites go to sleep after a while. They take a little while to wake up.
- The url for the site is bad looking and hard to remember.
- Who would remember to type in [https://210-recreate-the-rest-of-world-homepage-zkibostudent1.tk5-web.repl.co/](https://210-recreate-the-rest-of-world-homepage-zkibostudent1.tk5-web.repl.co/) ?

Using Replit to publish and share your sites is great. You are strongly encouraged to continue to use it that way.

Next, we’re going to talk about using Github Pages to publish your site, as an alternative to Replit. Then in the next lesson, we’ll talk about how to set up domain names.

# Publishing using Github Pages

There are three steps:

1. Sign in to Github
2. Connect your Replit project to Github
3. Publish your new Github repository using Github Pages.

## About Github

For developers, Github is like Instagram or TikTok. It’s a place to share and remix ideas, see content from other developers, and to get a sense of what’s going on. Unlike other social media, Github is also a serious professional tool, used by teams of thousands of engineers to build complex software projects.

Sharing projects on Github is a typical way that developers show off their skills and build their portfolio of work. Like Replit, Github stores your code. It also has a built-in free publishing tool called Github Pages.

We haven’t covered anything about Git, the version control tool at the heart of Github, but you can use Github’s Pages feature without knowing about Git. Here’s how to do it, step by step.

## Create a Github Account

If you already have a Github account, just sign in. Otherwise, visit [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and click *Sign Up*. From there, fill in your information and confirm your email address.

## Connect your Replit project to Github

Replit knows how to connect your project with Github, and store and sync the code.

Here’s a recap of the steps:

1. Pick a Replit project you’d like to store on Github and publish through Github Pages. (the project doesn’t have to be done yet!)
2. In the Replit project, click the branching tree icon for Version Control (it’s on the left panel below the files icon)
3. Click “Connect to Github”
    - Replit will prompt you to connect your Github account to your Replit account. Follow the prompts. Select “All Repositories” when prompted.
    - Go back to Replit after you’ve finished the steps to connect your accounts.
4. Click “Connect to Github” again. This time, it will allow you to enter the name of a new **Repository** (Github’s term for a project).
    - You can add a name and description for your project, which will show up on Github.
    - A “Public” repository will be visible. If you want other developers to see it, make it public.
    - The code for a “Private” repository will not be visible, but you can still publish the site using Github Pages.

Here’s a recap of the video:

1. Go to the Repository for your project on Github
2. Click “Settings” from the menu
3. Click “Pages” on the left sidebar of the Settings page
4. Select a branch (there should only be one, called `main`) and click “Save”

Your site should be available on Github Pages with a [github.io](http://github.io) domain name in a few minutes.

## Other Servers and Hosts

There are lots of other services available to act as the server for your webpages. We aren’t going to mention them here, but it’s worth knowing that these aren’t your only options.

- There are other tools like Replit and Github that serve your pages as you’ve designed them.
- There are also tons of tools for writing custom servers, so your code decides what to send to the client.

Next, you’ll learn how to setup your website on its own custom domain.
