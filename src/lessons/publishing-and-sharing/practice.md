# Practice

<aside>


üí° This is your chance to put what you‚Äôve learned into action. Try solving these practice challenges to check that you understand the concepts.

The solutions to each challenge are available in Replit, and you can view a video of the solution below each challenge. Try to go through the whole challenge without using the solution.

</aside>

*If you can‚Äôt do the challenge without looking the solution, it means you don‚Äôt understand the material well enough yet. Try the next practice challenge without looking at the solution. If you need more practice challenges, reach out on Discord.*

**If you get stuck**
1. Read the instructions again.
2. Remember **G**o **C**limb **K**ibo - first Google, then ask the Community on Discord, then reach out to Kibo instructional team.
3. You can click ‚Äò**Submit**‚Äô in Replit to view a solution. Don‚Äôt forget to try the solution out in your own code, and submit the project again.

## Publish and share a site

Instead of focusing on building from scratch, this project asks you to polish a previous project, publish it, and share it.

- Find one of your prior projects (the project from your live classes, the Content Gallery, or your profile page might be a good choice, but you can pick any project).
- Publish your site
    - You can use Replit, Github Pages, or something else
    - If you want, set up a custom domain for your site
- Make that project even better
    - Test it, and make improvements
    - Add `<title>` and `<meta>` tags to give it cool link previews
    - Add a favicon
    - Write a Readme file
- Share your site
    - Send the link in Discord to share with the Kibo Community
    - Share the link with friends, family, or classmates, to show off what you‚Äôve learned

There isn‚Äôt a separate repo for you to start or submit this project. We‚Äôll see your work when you share it in Discord.
