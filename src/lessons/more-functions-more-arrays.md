# More Functions, More Arrays

This week, we are going to continue exploring the fundamentals of the JavaScript language. Last week, we explored functions and arrays briefly. This week, we'll be going deeper and exploring more of their capabilities. 

If you are yet to review the lessons from last week, or yet to fully grasp the concepts covered last week, it is advisable to go through the content again.


Finally, in programming, we always have errors. This week we'll also learn more about how to debug code and fix errors that we will inevitably have.

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Use several Array methods
- Use several Math properties and methods
- Use several String methods
- Understand how higher-order functions work
- Debug your Javascript code more effectively
