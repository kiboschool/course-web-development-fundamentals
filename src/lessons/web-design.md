# Web design

In week 1, you learned the basics of CSS. So you already know:

- CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the page
- Use `<link>` to connect CSS to an HTML page: <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
- CSS selectors like p, .details, or #title
- Basic CSS properties like color

But... the sites you made in Week 1 were not pretty!

It’s not enough to apply just any styles. You have to know which styles to apply to make your site look good.

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Style text size, font, spacing, and color
- Choose and apply colors to a webpage
- Use margin, padding, and border to manage the space between elements
- Have an idea of cool projects you can build using HTML and CSS
