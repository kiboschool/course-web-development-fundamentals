# Project: Rest of World Landing Page

<aside>

**ðŸ‘¥ This is a team project**. Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team) from your squad, and schedule time to work on the project together.

</aside>

If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are also allowed to work on your own, but itâ€™s good practice to work together.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammateâ€™s version (**which you all created together**!).
