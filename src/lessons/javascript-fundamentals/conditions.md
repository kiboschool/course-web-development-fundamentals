# Conditions

In programming, you often want to make a decision based on the state of a variable. Given a condition, the program can take one or several actions. Similar to the Pyhton programming language, we have `if...else` construct and its several flavours to help the program make appropriate decisions.

Based on the assumption that you already know how conditions work from Python, this lesson will focus more on the JavaScript syntax. The `if...else` constructs work similarly in both programming languages, however the syntax is different.

## The `if...else` syntax

The basic `if...else` syntax in JavaScript:

```js

if (condition) {
    /* code to run, if the condition is true */
    
} else {
    /* code to run, if the condition is false */
}
```

If you do not want to execute any line of code if the condition is false, you can simple skip the `else` construct.

```js
if (condition){
    // code to run, if the condition is true
}
```

Although you can leave out the curly brackets in the JavaScript syntax, it is better to have them in to ensure code readability.

## More than two choices - `else if`
If you want to handle more than two choices, we do that with the `else if` construct.

## Nested if...else

It is also possible to nest `if...else` statements, that is, to have an `if...else` statement inside another one. See a sample syntsx below.

```js
if (condition_1) {
    // this block runs if condition_1 is true
  if (condition_1a) {
    /* code to run, if the condition_1a is true */
  } else if (condition_1b) {
    /* code to run, if the condition_1b is true */
  }
}
```

You can also test multiple conditions without using the nested...if. How? By using the logical operators - `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.

### Activity
1. Write an `if-else` statement to check if a given number is even or odd. Print `X is even` or `X is odd` depending on the value of the number.

2. Write a program to print the largest of three numbers.

## The `switch` statement
Have you ever used the `switch` keyword in any programming task? If the only other language you have learned is Python, chances are that you have never come across the `switch` construct, because it does not exist in Python.

With the `if...else` construct, the syntax can feel a little cumbersome, if you have a larger number of choices possible. In such cases, the `switch` statement might be a better option. If you want to check the value of a variable or expression and based on the value, make one of several choices, then `switch` comes in really handy.

### Syntax of the Switch Statement
```
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
```

How does the `switch` statement work? First, the `switch(expression)` is evaluated. This is evaluated only once. Next, the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. If there is a matching case, the code block of that case is executed, as well as all other blocks until a `break` clause is encountered. If there is no matching case, the default code block is executed. Let us see an example.

```
let day = "one";
switch(day){
  case "one":
    console.log("The first day of the week is Sunday");
    break;
  
  case "two":
    console.log("The second day of the week is Monday");
    break;

  default:
    console.log("There are only seven days in a week");
}
```

In the example, because `day` is set to one, `case "one"` is matched and "The first day of the week is Sunday" is printed to the console. Try the code snippet and change the value of day. Change it to `two`, and then change it to `eight`. Do you understand why the code behave the way it does?

Note that `expression` can be any valid JavaScript expression. Read more on `switch` statements on the [MDN site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch).

### Activity
üëâüèø **Try it**: Complete the code snippet above, so that is prints details of all the days of the week. For example, if `day` is set to `three`, it should print "The second day of the week is Tuesday". Ensure it only prints for the day of the week given.
