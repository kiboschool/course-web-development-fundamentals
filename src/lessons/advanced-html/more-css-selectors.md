# More CSS Selectors

Last week, we talked about CSS selectors. Head back to Week 1, if you need a recap on that. 

Basically CSS selectors define the patterns to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then applied. As you already know, we use CSS to style our web pages; the selectors help us to specify which elements we want to style.

In this lesson, we take a deeper dive into CSS Selectors. First, watch this video that covers all CSS Selectors in less than 20 minutes
