# What is web design

In week 1, you learned the basics of CSS. So you already know:

- CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the page
- Use `link` to connect CSS to an HTML page: `<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />`
- CSS selectors like `p`, `.details`, or `#title`
- Basic CSS properties like `color`

**But the sites you made in Week 1 were not pretty!**

It‚Äôs not enough to apply just any styles. You have to know *which styles to apply* to make your site look... actually good.

## Noticing

Getting a site to look good starts with noticing what doesn‚Äôt look right. Then, you can make large or small changes to the design to fix it.

You‚Äôve visited tons of websites in your life, and you‚Äôve noticed that some sites look good, and others look bad. Now, you‚Äôll need to hone this skill. You will learn to tell *why* some sites look good and others look bad.

## Practice: Noticing

<aside>

üëÄ **[Can‚Äôt Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)** is a game to help you practice **noticing** designs that are right and wrong.

1. Go to [Can‚Äôt Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)
2. For each level, click on the better design
3. Try to get through at least all of the Easy levels.

**Once you are done playing, consider the following reflection questions**

- Were some design mistakes easier or harder to notice?
- Do you think you could spot the mistakes without the comparison image?

## What makes a site look good?

Everyone has different taste, so there‚Äôs no universal ‚Äúbest‚Äù style. All the same, some sites look good and others don‚Äôt. Usually, what makes sites look good is a combination of just a few characteristics:

- Text Styling
- Spacing
- Colors
- Box model
- Layout


CSS has tools for styling each of these. We‚Äôll focus on some of these in this next lesson.

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/curriculumpad/d2dflxj3sbkz9fli" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

## Further Exploration

If you want to read more about visual design, see [Clean Up Your Mess: A Guide to Visual Design For Everyone](https://www.visualmess.com/) (10 min).

It discusses what makes a design ‚Äúclean‚Äù and how to communicate what‚Äôs important. In particular, it focuses on how to use spacing, size, proximity, and alignment to create contrast and a visual hierarchy.

## Practice: CSS Diner

You're going to be using CSS Selectors a _ton_ this week.

If you skipped it in Week 1 (or if you just want to practice selectors more), [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) is a great place to practice selectors.

There are 30 short exercises to practice selecting the plates, the food, or the table.
