# Advanced HTML

This week, you'll learn and practice more HTML tags.

There are more tags than you'll ever need to memorize. However, it's helpful to be familiar with lots of the common tags, so that you know which to reach for when building websites.

You'll also learn about _Semantic HTML_: using HTML tags that have the right _meaning_. Semantic HTML helps create well-structured, accessible, and search engine-friendly web pages while providing a better experience for users.

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:
- Use HTML Tables to structure data
- Use Multimedia elements to embed content
- Use common elements to create interactivity using HTML
- Use Semantic HTML to add meaning to pages
