# Advanced JavaScript

You've seen JavaScript basics, and how to use JavaScript to make changes on webpages in response to events. But, JavaScript is much bigger than what you can write on your own in a webpage!

JavaScript can run outside the browser. The most used outside-of-browser JavaScript runtime is called _Node_. It can be used much like Python -- from the terminal, as a scripting language, or on a server.

JavaScript also has libraries of code that you can use, called _modules_. You'll learn how to load code from modules into your own projects. You'll also see how you can use HTML and CSS libraries and frameworks.

Finally, you'll get a glimpse of how the practice exercises have worked all this course, with a look at testing.

## Final Project

This week, you'll also begin work on your final project.

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Run JavaScript programs in the terminal with Node
- Install and use JavaScript modules
- Use HTML and CSS libraries
- Read and write basic JavaScript tests
