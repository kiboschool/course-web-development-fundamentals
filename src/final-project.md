# Description

Your final project will be a website you design and create with a team.

Youâ€™ve learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. The final
project is your chance to build a website of your own design from scratch.

There are few requirements. You must use the knowledge you learned in the
course, as outlined in the rubric below.

## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide the topic for your final project. The challenge is to
choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that itâ€™s
overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Hereâ€™s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project youâ€™ll be
able to complete.

- Your final project should be more advanced than the exercises you've done. It should be a complete website that achieves a goal.
- Donâ€™t plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use
  mostly what youâ€™ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the
  things you run into along the way).

### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We havenâ€™t covered how to collect and save data from users. Donâ€™t plan to build
a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site.

## Submission
- Submit your work on your Github Repository for the team.
- Submit your source code on Gradescope as a team.
- Submit the link to the video demo as a team on Gradescope.
- Submit your work on Woolf, individually.

### Guidelines on the Video Submission
- Length of video should be between 5 to 7 minutes.
- The video should begin with a brief overview/description of your website.
- Video should show all pages of the website (running on a browser).
- Video should contain a code walkthrough, going through all your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
  - Explain your choice of HTML elements, CSS layouts etc.
- Upload the video to Youtube using your Kibo account and submit the link.

## How should you work together?

Youâ€™ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how youâ€™ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
