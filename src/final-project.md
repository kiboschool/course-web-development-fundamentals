# Final project

---

**Due Date: TBD**

Your final project will be a website you design and create with a team.

# Description

Youâ€™ve learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. The final project is your chance to build a website of your own design from scratch.

ðŸ‘¥ **The final project will be a team project**. You can have up to three people on your team. You can work with teammates youâ€™ve worked with before, or find new teammates.

If you have trouble finding a partner, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord to see who else needs a team. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are allowed to work independently, but itâ€™s good practice to work together.

Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join the team together.

## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide what your final project will be. The challenge is to choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that itâ€™s overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Hereâ€™s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project youâ€™ll be able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated exercises and projects youâ€™ve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Donâ€™t plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use mostly what youâ€™ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the things you run into along the way).

### The Project

YouTube need a low-bandwidth front page with just videos. Choose up to 6 videos from YouTube to showcase on the this front page, include titles and descriptions for each video. Come up with a distinct theme so that it's distinguishable from the main YouTube website. Users do not need to be able to search, you don't need to collect any user data. Use JavaScript to add some interesting interactions, if you're comfortable with JS.

This is your time to really play to your strengths, if you're more comfortable with CSS play into that, if you're comfortable with JS, showcase that too! Have fun with it! You don't have to copy the current YouTube website, you can be creative but your site needs to be accessible and easy to read.

At the end of the project, write a short essay explaining the decisions you made within the project and your input within the group. This essay should be at least 500words and at most 800words.

## Rubric

You should:

- [ ] A website that has up to 6 videos
- [ ] A theme that uses accessible colours and typography
- [ ] Deploy this online

### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We havenâ€™t covered how to collect and save data from users. Donâ€™t plan to build a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site.

## How should you work together?

Youâ€™ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how youâ€™ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
