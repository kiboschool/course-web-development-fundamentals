# Final project

---

**Due Date: TBD**

Your final project will be a website you design and create with a team.

# Description

Youâ€™ve learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. The final project is your chance to build a website of your own design from scratch.

ðŸ‘¥ **The final project will be a team project**. You can work with teammates youâ€™ve worked with before, or find new teammates.

Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join the team together.

## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide what your final project will be. The challenge is to choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that itâ€™s overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Hereâ€™s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project youâ€™ll be able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated exercises and projects youâ€™ve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Donâ€™t plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use mostly what youâ€™ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the things you run into along the way).

### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We havenâ€™t covered how to collect and save data from users. Donâ€™t plan to build a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site.

## How should you work together?

Youâ€™ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how youâ€™ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
