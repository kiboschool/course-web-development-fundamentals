ðŸ‘¥ **This is a team project**.

*You must work in a team of 2-3 students*

* You can work with teammates youâ€™ve worked with
before, or find new teammates.
* Communicate with your teammates, then join the
Github team together and schedule time to work on the project. _DO NOT_ join a team before you have communicated with your teammates.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new project in
Replit and sharing the join link with your teammates. You should be sure that
both of your names are linked to the submission in Github and Gradescope.

## How should you work together?

The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Agree early on how you will communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas, the tasks to be performed and how you plan to execute the tasks (task allocation). The doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
