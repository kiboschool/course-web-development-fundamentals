<aside>

ðŸ‘¥ **This is a team project**. You can work with teammates youâ€™ve worked with
before, or find new teammates. Communicate with your teammates, then join the
Github team together and schedule time to work on the project.

Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what
you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join
the team together.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new project in
Replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should be sure that
both of your names are linked to the submission in Github and Gradescope.

## How should you work together?

Youâ€™ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how youâ€™ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas, the tasks to be performed and how you plan to execute the tasks (task allocation). The doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
