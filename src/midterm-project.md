ðŸ‘¥ **This is a team project**.

*You must work in a team of 3 students*

* Find teammates to work with, decide on a team name and ensure that you have submitted your details in this [Google form](https://forms.gle/bB9jYU9opJm7sj4U8).

* Accept the assignment, then join the Github team together and schedule time to work on the project. _DO NOT_ join a team before you have communicated with your teammates.

    * Decide on who would create the team. The team should be created only once on Github (when accepting the assignment). Other members should join the already created team.

    * Before creating a team, search for the team to verify that the team has not been created.

* Please notify the instructor  if anyone who isÂ  not a member of your team joins your team on the GitHub Classroom.

* If you join a wrong team on GitHub by accident, please notify the instructor immediately.

* Ensure that you submit the assignment as a team on Gradescope.

## How should you work together?

The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Agree early on how you will communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas, the tasks to be performed and how you plan to execute the tasks (task allocation). The doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
